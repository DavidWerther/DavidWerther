Graduating 2023(Hopefully)
I am 17 years old from plymouth meeting PA, but I love to spend my summers at the NJ beach.
I enrolled in GA in 8th grade from Colonial Middle School.
2 Brothers- Matt and Jamie
1 Dog- Gus

Previous coding experience-
I do not have a lot of previous experience with coding. I have used websites to learn parts of html and python, and I took part of a summer course provided by the University of Michigan. I also took a coding class at my middle school, but I don't know much outside of cosmetic coding and buttons. 

Reason(s) for taking this class.
My brother is a computer science major and last summer he worked for the phillies as a software engineer. Seeing the exciting oppurtunities this subject can provide, I thought why not try it out?

Other interests (academic or otherwise). 
In school I find myself most interested in literary subjects like english and hitsory. I'm enjoying those subjects this year especially, becuase of the content they cover and its relevancy to the current political landscape.
Outside of my schoolwork I love music, snowboarding, soccer, hockey, cooking, and movies.

Goals you have for this class and/or projects you'd like to complete. 
Honestly I am not quite sure yet becuase I have no idea the extent of what i'll be able to do with the coding knowledge I gain from this course. At the least, I think it would be pretty cool to design a racing game or some sort of organizational tool that I could actually use in college.
